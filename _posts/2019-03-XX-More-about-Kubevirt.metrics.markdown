# More about KubeVirt and Prometheus metrics

In this blog post, we update about the KubeVirt metrics, continuining [the series started earlier this year](https://kubevirt.io/2019/An-overview-to-KubeVirt-metrics.html).
Since the previous post, the [initial groundwork and first set of metrics](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/1840) was merged, and it is expected
to be available with kubevirt v0.15.0 and onwards.

## New metrics

This is the initial set of metrics exposed by kubevirt 0.15.0:
```
```

## Coming next

The *KubeVirt team* is still working to enhance and refine the metrics support. There are two main active topics. First, discussion is ongoing about adding more metrics, depending on the the needs of the community - see [this issue for example](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/issues/2023).
Furthermore, there is [work in](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/issues/2011) [progress](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/issues/2012) to increase the robustness and the reliability of the monitoring.
Stay tuned for more updates!
